1. computer : 计算机试可以被指示通过计算机编程自动执行算数或逻辑运算序列的设备。 wiki原文： A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming.                                      ![计算机](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer#/media/File:Intertec_Superbrain.jpg)
2. computer science : 计算机科学是对理论，实验和工程的研究，它们构成了计算机设计和使用的基础。 wiki原文： Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers.
3. software : 计算机软件或软件是一个通用术语，指的是告诉计算机如何工作的数据或计算机指令集合，与构建系统的物理硬件相比，实际执行工作。 wiki原文： Computer software, or simply software, is a generic term that refers to a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built, that actually performs the work.
4. software engineering : 软件工程是系统方法中工程应用于软件开发的应用。wiki原文：Software engineering is the application of engineering to the development of software in a systematic method.
5. Alan Turing : 艾伦 图灵（1912.6.23~1954.6.7），英国计算机科学家，数学家，逻辑学家，密码学家，哲学家和理论生物学家。 wiki原文： Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (/?tj??r??/; 23 June 1912?– 7 June 1954) was an English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.                                                                                              ![图灵](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#/media/File:Alan_Turing_Aged_16.jpg)
6. Moore's Law : 摩尔定律观察到密集电路中的晶体管数量大约每两年翻一番。 wiki原文：Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years. The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel, whose 1965 paper described a doubling every year in the number of components per integrated circuit,[2] and projected this rate of growth would continue for at least another decade.
